## Installation

If you're just getting started with Python, we recommend downloading and installing Continuum's [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html) or the free edition of Enthought's [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/downloads/).

Anaconda:

```
conda update conda
conda update ipython
```

Enthought Canopy:

```
enpkg ipython
```

### Upgrading

If you have IPython notebook installed already, great! We'll need IPython 2.2+ for this tutorial session, so [upgrade in your preferred way](http://ipython.org/install.html).


## TODO

* [ ] Bring in [ipython-in-depth materials](https://github.com/ipython/ipython-in-depth)
* [ ] Set up base image for tmpnb
* [X] Add installation instructions here in the README
