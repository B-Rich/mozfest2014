Introduction to the IPython Notebook at MozFest 2014!

Please install the IPython notebook ahead of time. If you have trouble, come find us and we'll help you out!

## Installation

If you're just getting started with Python, we recommend downloading and installing Continuum's [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads.html) or the free edition of Enthought's [Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/downloads/).

Alternatively, there is a Docker image available with kernels for Julia, Python, and R called `ipython/mozfest2014`. It is ~3.5 GB though, so you'll need to be mindful of where you run it (boot2docker starts with a small disk). If time allows, we'll have some temporary servers up in London that will be preloaded with this image (wifi permitting).

### Upgrading

If you have IPython notebook installed already, great! We'll need IPython 2.2+ for this tutorial session, so [upgrade in your preferred way](http://ipython.org/install.html).

Anaconda:

```
conda update conda
conda update ipython
```

Enthought Canopy:

```
enpkg ipython
```
